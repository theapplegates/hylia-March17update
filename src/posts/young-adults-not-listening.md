This is why the government is asking people to stay home. I don’t want to see you on the beach. I don’t want to see interviews of twenty-somethings saying I don’t care if I get COVID-19. You know what, I don’t care if you get it either. I do care about you giving my grandmother COVID-19 or any family member of mine. Grow up.
