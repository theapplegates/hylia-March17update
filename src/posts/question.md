As we were driving to lunch the wife and I noticed that the traffic signal near the mall was not working.

We turned into the mall and saw the stores had power. As we got inside we saw the mall did not have many lights on, but it did not look like it lost power.    As we were eating I noticed the escalators were not working and asked the wife I wonder if someone has to walk around and restart them when the power comes back on. I figured they had to because otherwise people would fall when the power came back on. Just thinking.




<!–Use data-srcset, data-src and specify lazyload class for images –>
<picture>
  <source data-srcset=‘small.webp’ type=“image/webp” media=“(max-width: 500px)”>
  <source data-srcset=‘medium.webp’ type=“image/webp” media=“(max-width: 900px)”>
  <source data-srcset=‘large.webp’ type=“image/webp” media=“(min-width: 901px)”>
  <source data-srcset=‘small.jpg’ type=“image/jpg” media=“(max-width: 500px)”>
  <source data-srcset=‘medium.jpg’ type=“image/jpg” media=“(max-width: 900px)”>
  <source data-srcset=‘large.jpg’ type=“image/jpg” media=“(min-width: 901px)”>
  <img data-src=“/images/Escalator.jpg” class=“lazyload”
    alt=“Your Alt Text Here” title=“Your Title Text Here” />
</picture>
<!–Use noscript to make sure images are indexed –>
<noscript>
    <img src=“/images/Escalator.jpg” alt=“Your Alt Text Here” title=“Your Title Text Here” />
